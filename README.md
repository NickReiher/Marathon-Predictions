# Marathon-Predictions
Machine learning models that predict the finishing times of marathon runners. 

So far I have created two models to predict the times of runners in the 2017 Berlin Marathon, based on their starting time, gender, age, and country: here's the Jupyter Notebook - https://github.com/NickVance/Marathon-Predictions/blob/master/Berlin%20Marathon%20Predictions.ipynb

Future projects:
- see how the models work at predicting the results of the 2018 Berlin Marathon
- add more historical data and create models that predic the results of the 2019 Berlin Marathon
- extend the models to work on other marathons: ones that I have the complete results on (at least for a couple of years) and ones that I have limited data on (for example, only the winning time or average finishing time)
